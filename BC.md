# What is blockchain
* Business networks are often inefficient because 
  * each participant in the network keeps records, or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. 
  * This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.

* One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.
