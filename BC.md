# Blockchain essentials

* [IBM Think Academy: Blockchain, How it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD9KAnkZUjU)


# understand
* learn common challenges facing business networks and how a new approach to recording and processing transactions that uses blockchain technology
* Blockchain and distributed ledger systems in a business environment
* Important concepts and key use cases of blockchain for business
* How assets can be transferred in a blockchain network


# What is blockchain
* Business networks are often inefficient because 
  * each participant in the network keeps records, or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. 
  * This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.

* One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.


# Business Network

* [An Example Business Network -- Car Auction Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgSKkrlLugQ)


* Business Network
  * Participants are customers, suppliers, banks, partners
  * Cross geography & gegulatory boundary
* Wealth 
  * Geneated by the folw of goods & services accorss business network in transcations and contracts
* Markets
  * Public (Fruit market, car auction)
  * Private (Supply chain finanacing, bonds)


# Transferring assets, building value 
* Anything that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value is asert

* Two funtamental types of asset
  * Tangible, e.g. a house
  * Intangible, e.g. a mortgage
    * Intangible assets subdivide
      * Finacial ex: bond
      * Intellectual, ex: patents
      * Digital, Ex: Music

* Cash is also an asset
  * Has property of anonymity
  
# Ledgers
* **Ledger** is it is system of record for a business. Business will have multiple ledgers for multiple business network in which they participate.
* **Transcation** - An assert trasnfer onto or off the ledger
  * John gives a car to Mike
* **Contract** conditipons for transcation to occur
  * If Mike pays John money, then car passes from John to Mike
  * if car won't start, function do not pass to John

Shared Ledger
* Records all the transcations accross business network
* shared between participants
* Participants have own copy through replication
* Permissioned, so participants see only appropirate transcations
* The shared system of record


Smart Contracts
Business rules implied by the contract, embedded in the Blokchain and executed with the transcation
Verifie, signed
Encoded in programming language
Example: Defineds contracual conditions under which corporate bond transfer occures

Privacy
* The ledger is shared but participants require privacy
* Participants needs
  * Appropriate confidentality between subsets of participants
  * idendity not linked to a transcation
* Transcations needs to be authenticated
* Cryptography central to these processes

Trust
* THe ledger is a trusted source of information
* participants endorse transcations
  * Business network decides who will endorder transcations
  * Endorsed trascation are added to the ledger with appropriate confidentiality
* Asserts have a verifiable audit trails
  * Trancations cannot be modified, inserted or deleted
* Achieved through consensus, provenance, immutability and finality
