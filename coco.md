The Coco Framework is not a blockchain itself and it is not tied to Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing service.

### Public blockchain network
* Members (nodes) are anonymous and have access to the ledger.
* They can participate to achieve consensus through POW.

### Consortium blockchain network
* Members are not anonymous, they are known to the network.
* Node operations are controlled by EVM (in case of Ethereum consortium blockchain)


COCO is a foundation for all blockchain protocols. It provides base components like persistent ledger, node to node and application to node secure communications etc. to other blockchain protocols.
Coco system consists of validating nodes termed as VNs. Each VN runs Coco framework and particular blockchain protocol. Every VN can verify the identity of other VN hence they are trusted. As per Coco framework white paper, VN can be further divided into logical components and can be categories into host or enclave.

Microsoft Coco can handle 1600 transactions per second with low hundreds of millisecond latency. This about 100 times better than other non-Coco protocols.
